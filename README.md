# BuildHelper Lib

The build helper library project started out as a utility that I could use for doing build commands both pre and post build.

The project is currently transitioning and becoming more of a generic command system.  
 
The code tries to use best practices as much as possible in terms of dependency injection and interfaces.

This repo includes a number of command plugins that are helpful during a build process.  

There is still a lot of work to be done and I will eventually get around to creating an IDE that you can visually create and edit commands.
